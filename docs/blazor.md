# Blazor
The following chapter show some tips and tricks in regards to **Blazor**.

## `CascadingValue` fixed
CascadingValues are used, as the name implies, the cascade a parameter down the hierarchy. The problem with that is, that every child component will listen to changes to the original value. This can get expensive. If your component does not rely on updates, you can pin / fix this value. For that you can use the IsFixed parameter.

‚ùå **Bad** 
```razor
<CascadingValue Value="this">
    <SomeOtherComponents>
</CascadingValue>
```

‚úÖ **Good** If the component does **not** need further updates (or the value never changes anyway) we can **fix** the value.
```razor
<CascadingValue Value="this" IsFixed="true">
    <SomeOtherComponents>
</CascadingValue>
```

## `@key` directive
Blazor diff engine determines which elements have to be re-rendered on every render cycle. It does that via sequence numbers. That works in most of cases very well, but adding or removing items in the middle or at the beginning of the list, will lead to re-rendering the whole list instead of the single entry. 

‚ùå **Bad** 
```razor
<ul>
    @foreach (var item in items)
    {
        <li>@item</li>
    }
</ul>
```

‚úÖ **Good** Helping Blazor how it should find the difference between two render cycles.
```razor
<ul>
    @foreach (var item in items)
    {
        @* With the @key attribute we define what makes the element unique
           Based on this Blazor can determine whether or not it has to re-render
           the element
        *@
        <li @key="item">@item</li>
    }
</ul>
```
