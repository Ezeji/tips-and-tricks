# async await
The following chapter will deep dive into tips, tricks and pitfalls when it comes down to `async` and `await` in C#.

## Elide await keyword - Exceptions
Eliding the await keyword can lead to a less traceable stacktrace due to the fact that every `Task` which doesn't get awaited, will not be part of the stack trace.

‚ùå **Bad**
```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

try
{
	await DoWorkWithoutAwaitAsync();
}
catch (Exception e)
{
	Console.WriteLine(e);
}

static Task DoWorkWithoutAwaitAsync()
{
	return ThrowExceptionAsync();
}

static async Task ThrowExceptionAsync()
{
	await Task.Yield();
	throw new Exception("Hey");
}
```

Will result in

```
System.Exception: Hey  
 at Program.<<Main>$>g__ThrowExceptionAsync|0_1()  
 at Program.<Main>$(String[] args)  
``` 

‚úÖ **Good** If speed and allocation is not very crucial, add the `await` keyword.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

try
{
	await DoWorkWithoutAwaitAsync();
}
catch (Exception e)
{
	Console.WriteLine(e);
}

static async Task DoWorkWithoutAwaitAsync()
{
	await ThrowExceptionAsync();
}

static async Task ThrowExceptionAsync()
{
	await Task.Yield();
	throw new Exception("Hey");
}
```

Will result in:
```
System.Exception: Hey
   at Program.<<Main>$>g__ThrowExceptionAsync|0_1()
   at Program.<<Main>$>g__DoWorkWithoutAwaitAsync|0_0()
   at Program.<Main>$(String[] args)
```

üí° Info: Eliding the `async` keyword will also elide the whole state machine. In very hot paths that might be worth a consideration. In normal cases one should not elide the keyword. The allocations one is saving is depending on the circumstances but a normally very very small especially if only smaller objects are passed around. Also performance-wise there is no big gain when eliding the keyword (we are talking nano seconds). Please measure first and act afterwards.

## Elide await keyword - using block
Eliding inside an `using` block can lead to a disposed object before the `Task` is finished.

‚ùå **Bad** Here the download will be aborted / the `HttpClient` gets disposed:
```csharp
public Task<string> GetContentFromUrlAsync(string url)
{
    using var client = new HttpClient();
        return client.GetStringAsync(url);
}
```

‚úÖ **Good**
```csharp
public async Task<string> GetContentFromUrlAsync(string url)
{
    using var client = new HttpClient();
        return await lient.GetStringAsync(url);
}
```

## Return `null` `Task` or `Task<T>`
When returning directly `null` from a synchronous call (no `async` or `await`) will lead to `NullReferenceException`:

‚ùå **Bad** Will throw `NullReferenceException`
```csharp
await GetAsync();

static Task<string> GetAsync()
{
	return null;
}
```

‚úÖ **Good** Use `Task.FromResult`:

```csharp
await GetAsync();

static Task<string> GetAsync()
{
	return Task.FromResult(null);
}
```
