# async await
The following chapter will deep dive into tips, tricks and pitfalls when it comes down to `async` and `await` in C#.

## Elide await keyword - Exceptions
Eliding the await keyword can lead to a less traceable stacktrace due to the fact that every `Task` which doesn't get awaited, will not be part of the stack trace.

‚ùå **Bad**
```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

try
{
	await DoWorkWithoutAwaitAsync();
}
catch (Exception e)
{
	Console.WriteLine(e);
}

static Task DoWorkWithoutAwaitAsync()
{
	return ThrowExceptionAsync();
}

static async Task ThrowExceptionAsync()
{
	await Task.Yield();
	throw new Exception("Hey");
}
```

Will result in

```
System.Exception: Hey  
 at Program.<<Main>$>g__ThrowExceptionAsync|0_1()  
 at Program.<Main>$(String[] args)  
``` 

‚úÖ **Good** If speed and allocation is not very crucial, add the `await` keyword.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

try
{
	await DoWorkWithoutAwaitAsync();
}
catch (Exception e)
{
	Console.WriteLine(e);
}

static async Task DoWorkWithoutAwaitAsync()
{
	await ThrowExceptionAsync();
}

static async Task ThrowExceptionAsync()
{
	await Task.Yield();
	throw new Exception("Hey");
}
```

Will result in:
```
System.Exception: Hey
   at Program.<<Main>$>g__ThrowExceptionAsync|0_1()
   at Program.<<Main>$>g__DoWorkWithoutAwaitAsync|0_0()
   at Program.<Main>$(String[] args)
```

üí° Info: Eliding the `async` keyword will also elide the whole state machine. In very hot paths that might be worth a consideration. In normal cases one should not elide the keyword. The allocations one is saving is depending on the circumstances but a normally very very small especially if only smaller objects are passed around. Also performance-wise there is no big gain when eliding the keyword (we are talking nano seconds). Please measure first and act afterwards.

## Elide await keyword - using block
Eliding inside an `using` block can lead to a disposed object before the `Task` is finished.

‚ùå **Bad** Here the download will be aborted / the `HttpClient` gets disposed:
```csharp
public Task<string> GetContentFromUrlAsync(string url)
{
    using var client = new HttpClient();
        return client.GetStringAsync(url);
}
```

‚úÖ **Good**
```csharp
public async Task<string> GetContentFromUrlAsync(string url)
{
    using var client = new HttpClient();
        return await lient.GetStringAsync(url);
}
```

# Blazor
The following chapter show some tips and tricks in regards to **Blazor**.

## `CascadingValue` fixed
CascadingValues are used, as the name implies, the cascade a parameter down the hierarchy. The problem with that is, that every child component will listen to changes to the original value. This can get expensive. If your component does not rely on updates, you can pin / fix this value. For that you can use the IsFixed parameter.

‚ùå **Bad** 
```razor
<CascadingValue Value="this">
    <SomeOtherComponents>
</CascadingValue>
```

‚úÖ **Good** If the component does **not** need further updates (or the value never changes anyway) we can **fix** the value.
```razor
<CascadingValue Value="this" IsFixed="true">
    <SomeOtherComponents>
</CascadingValue>
```
